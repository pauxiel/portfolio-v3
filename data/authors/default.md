I am Software Engineer with experience in frontend design and backend design. Over the past two years, I have gained experience designing and developing web applications. I am currently building an app called circle along with a team of four person.

I have always been fascinated by anything, software, and computer as a child. This was why I pursued a degree in electronic and Computer Engineering. During my second year, I did a little learning on the basics of web development. But I began pursuing my interest in software engineering during my final year at university. My school final year was to build an e-tax software.
After the project, my understanding of building interfaces, and database management deepens.

Right from my university days, I saw that software engineering was a highly rewarding field. So After my university days. I had already made up my mind that software engineering was the career I will follow.

Part of my achievement includes an earning of udacity Nanodegree certificate as a frontend developer and being among the top 50 hashnode writers In the month of May.
